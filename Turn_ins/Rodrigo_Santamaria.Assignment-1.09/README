Project's explanation:
    The folder contains subfolders:
        bin/    : executables "PokemonGame" is the name of the executable
        build   : binaries (*.o)
        src     : source code (*.cpp)
        inlcude : header files (*.h)
        test    : future features to test

Makefile:
    make            : will compile all the files
    make clean      : will delete the binaries
    make 'file.o'   : will compile for file

Program explanation:

At the beginning you will have to choose a pokemon,
then you are starting to playin. In the ':' may appear wild pokemons that you
can capture (if you can).

The battle GUI is formed by 4 windows:

    -top_left     = Trainer/WildPokemon information
    -top_right    = Your information and other menus
    -bottom_left  = The important messages should appear here
    -bottom_right = Your main choices are here (pokemon, fight, bag, run)

    To interact during the battle you should use the arrows and the Enter key

    After each turn you receive a feedback and must press any key to continue

    If you have no pokemon alive then you can't fight nor find wild_pokemons until
    you restore your pokes life.

    The B key will work as a bag out of the battle.

    Some messages might not be displayed because I didn't have time to code them all
    but be aware of some intuitive actions like:
        -Trying to apply a potion in a totally recovered pkm 
        -Trying to apply a revive to a alive pkm
        -Trying to capture the enemy's pokemon
