Project's explanation:
    The project is divided in folders. 
    src     = *.cpp
    include = *.h
    bin     = executables
    build   = *.o
    tests   = others

Makefile:

Make            will compile everything
Make [file.o]   will compile only file.o
Make clean      will delete any binary

The executable is PokemonGame and is in the /bin folder, so you can run ./bin/PokemonGame

Algorithm:

I created a class for pokemon and added an array of pointers to pokemon to the class
character.

It has a couple of constructors that help finding moves and other information from the pokemon.

At first we have the selection of the initial pokemon, one selected it will show the information
of that pokemon in form of a scrollable list that you can exit with ESC;

Every information is displayed as a scrollable list and you have to use the arrows UP and DOWN to 
move the cursor and to see more details (the pokemon information) must press the key 'o' when the
cursor is over the Pokemon you want to display. To exit press ESC.
