Project explanation:
I used the same files and structure from the previous assignment. I change the name of some variables and
inherite the class character to pc and npcs. I also changed my heap.c to heap.cpp.

Makefile:
make <file.o> to compile an specific file
make to compile them all
make clean to remove the binaries

Algorithm explanation:
I used the same code from assignment 1.02 to fly and move to a different world, I just changed a few things,
and solved some bugs.
