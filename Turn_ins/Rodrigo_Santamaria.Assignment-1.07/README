Project explanation:
I moved my files to 4 different directory:
    - '/src' has all my source files (.cpp/.c)
    - '/build' store all the object files when building the project
    - '/include' contains all the header files
    - '/bin' when the executables are generated

I created a header for 'data_classes' that will contain my classes for
each file. I also creater a source file in case I need to add some functions
to my classes.

Makefile:
Same commands as the previous one:
    make /build/[file_name].o:   will compile for main.cpp
    make                     :   will build everything
    make clean               :   will remove all the binaries

Algorithm explanation:

I used getline to capture each line and then run a for loop to separate the
each word between commas.

I created a class for each file.
