Project explanation:
This project is an implementation of the Hanoi Tower puzzle, which uses ncurses,
color and a backtracking algorithm to find the steps of the optimal steps.

Makefile:

make        : will build and generate the executable Hanoi
make clean  : will remove all the binaries

Game instructions:
You will have to use the cursors, the spacebar/Enter and the ESC key to interact.
At first its printed the title of the game and the main menu with the following options:

-New game       : will display a list of number of disks which you must select.
-Continue game  : will load the last unfinished game you have played
-Demo           : will display a list of number of disks which you must select.
-Credits        : will display the name of the creator.

In the game:
The Goal of the game is to move the disks to the third pin (from left to right),
you can only drop a disk if the pin is empty or if the disk at the top of the pin has a
size lower than the disk you are droping.

You have to use the 'spacebar' to pick or drop a disk.
The Left and Right arrow to move the disk.

Demo:
Will display the optimal solution, with the arrows Left and Right you can change the speed
of the animation.

General:
With ESC you go back or quit the game.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
There is another file pol_calc.cpp which a calculator of polynomios, you can compile it and try it
it's cool but as funny as this game lol
