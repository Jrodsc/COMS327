Project's explanation:
    I added a new c file with the struct for trainers, and pc. Also added the world struct that allow me to have 
    a map of trainers and only 4 SSSP arrays.

Makefile:
    It is a generic Makefile:

    'make' will compile everything
    'make [name_file].o' will compile for name_file only
    'make clean' deletes the binaries and objects files.

Algorithm:
    I generate randomly the number of trainers, with a maximum of 15 and I can also change easily the max numbers,
    then I chose them randomly and place them in random available positions.

    Every turn I update the trainers and pc movements following the instructions from the Assignment.

    For printing I use the char 2d array in my world instruction and the trainers in each map.
