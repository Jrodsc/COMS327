Project's explanation:

I made two programs, the first one is "Knights-tour.c" which is the basic assignment.
The second one is "Knights_tour_improved.c" where I include some extra challenges.

Makefile explanation:

"Knights_tour.c" compiles with the command 'make knights'.
"Knights_tour_improved.c" compiles with the command 'make knights_i'.

The binarys are called "knights" and "knights_i" respectively.

Algorithm explanation:

It is a Flood Fill (DFS) on a matrix, I used two arrays to define the knight's movements
and a 1 to define save the path.

For the improvements I used malloc to assigned the size of the arrays dinamically,
and other elements and function like FILE, getline, etc.

The program "Knights_tour.c" prints the output to stdout, and "Knights_tour_improved.c" to a file named "tours.txt".
