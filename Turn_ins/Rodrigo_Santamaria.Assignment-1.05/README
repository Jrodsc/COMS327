Project explanation:
The files are the same as the previos assignment. NCurses is added to the main.c and world.c files.

Building and running:
To compile make <file.o> (if needed)
To run: ./PokemonGame

Code explanation:
I created a procedure for each of the possible stages, (in_market, in_center, in_battle, show_list, notify, etc)

Each of those stop temporary the game loop until the user finish their tasks.

Each of those at the same time make the terrain black and white, and adding some background to the cells we are
selecting (or just relevant cells like pc or trainers)

When the user press an invalid command there is a line that shows "Invalid command" for half a second.

Once the a trainer have been defeated they will move as far as I can from the PC and they can fall into the water
and stay in a loop forever (:c it's not a bug lol).
