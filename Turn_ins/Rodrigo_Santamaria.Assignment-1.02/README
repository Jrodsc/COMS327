Project's explanation:

'tlib' is the name of the library I created with the functions I used in all my programs
'map' contains the previous code for each terrain, map_t now is my struct when I save
    the terrain and exits.
'queue' contains the struct for a dequeue
'main' contains the execution of game

Makefile:

Is the same makefile for the previous assignment, it works for every .c with any dependencies,
which means that the command 'make' build everything, and 'make [file_name]' builds the file,
it also contains the 'clean' function.

Algorithm's explanation:

I added flags to know when to keep an existing exit from a neighbours. I also created an 
map's pointer matrix of 401X401 and (200,200) is the internal origin. I clean the terminal
for each movement and provide an small feedback to the user. The probability of CC, and MM 
is set to randomly but each 50 maps it the decrease by 10%, so it would be easy to test, and 
later I can set different difficulty levels.
